# Access Logs

This repository is a play project to learn more about Python, and at the same time create a tool that can query access logs generated from an AWS CDN by using Athena

## Features

At some point it can hopefully read and parse the access logs to count the amount of visits to a page.

## Requirements

* An AWS account, with credentials setup on your machine
* Python 3

## Usage

Don't even know myself yet.
